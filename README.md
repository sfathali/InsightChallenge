## Problem
The Bureau of Transportation Statistics regularly makes available data on the number of vehicles, equipment, passengers and pedestrians crossing into the United States by land.

**For this challenge, I will calculate the total number of times vehicles, equipment, passengers and pedestrians cross the U.S.-Canadian and U.S.-Mexican borders each month. In addition, I will find the running monthly average of total number of crossings for that type of crossing and border from the input dataset provided to me.**

## Language and Libraries Used
I used C# .NET 4.6.1 to solve this problem. Sticking to the problem statement, I avoided the use of any NuGet libraries and opted for the default included libraries. Only references are:

Microsoft.CSharp
System
System.Core
System.Data

In addition, I made another file using SQL commands (using SQLite) to show my flexibility.

### How to run my work?

Run the ```run.sh``` bash file, which will call my ./src/BorderCrossingAnalysis/bin/Release/BorderCrossingAnalysis.exe console application.
